## If you're a streamer:
Please head over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/gezelio/ytcr/releases) and download v2.0.0 and update your StreamerBot. This update is required for the new features to work.

## If you're a viewer:
Your previous points may be gone I'm afraid! This is due to a rework of our database and it was easier to start fresh.
