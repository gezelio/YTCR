# What is an Action ID?
An `Action ID` is a unique identifier for a specific action that can be performed by [StreamerBot](https://streamer.bot). It is used to identify the action that should be performed when a specific command is received by the bot.

## When do I need to fill this in?
If you're adding a reward that you want to trigger something from [StreamerBot](https://streamer.bot), you'll need to fill in the `Action ID` field. This is so that [StreamerBot](https://streamer.bot) knows what action to perform when the reward is redeemed.

## How do I get an Action ID?
You can get an `Action ID` by: 
1. Creating an action in [StreamerBot](https://streamer.bot)
2. Right click on the action and select `Copy Action ID`

**Important** - Don't forget you'll need to click "Save" after making any changes in StreamerBot!
