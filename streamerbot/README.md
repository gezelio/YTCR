## The latest versions of the StreamerBot implementation
From time to time, we have to update the StreamerBot actions, which will require you the actions.

## How to update
1. Download the latest version [here]()
2. Launch StreamerBot and remove the following Actions:
  - `Clipping Tool`
  - `Execute Channel Reward Redeem`
  - `Set Channel Rewards`
3. Go to `Import` and import the latest file, giving you the newest versions
4. Complete the steps for our [websocket connection](https://github.com/gezelio/ytcr#2-websocket) to ensure the actions are properly linked
5. Restart StreamerBot
6. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
